### *The easiest way to clone a github repo*

Use [ezsh](https://github.com/AAATBSGSHU/ezsh) to install this script easily. It will automatically create the below alias for you.
```
# AAATBSGSHU
alias ezclone='/location/of/your/script/ezclone.sh'
```
To then run it just use ```ezclone https://github.com/accountname/reponame.git ```
